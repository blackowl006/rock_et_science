# rock_et_science
A place to rock with science, to create apps working like a magic wand

Blackowl is my nickname. I like to read and I like to nap in the afternoon. I found math very interesting and useful. I hope I can advance my knowledge in math and apply math in my scientific work. I found one of the best ways to learn about physical science is through the use of computer modeling.  I hope this platform can allow me to collaborate with people who would like to build apps that can facilitate the work of a scientist.
